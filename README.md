# mlsTasks2020
***


### This repository contains a jupyter notebook with all four tasks for the module Machine Learning and Statistics for the year 2020.

The notebook is divided into four clearly defined sections. Each section contains a description of the task accompanied by the solution and relevant references. I provide a walkthrough of the process I take in arriving at the solution. The programming language used for each task is Python.

## Task 1 - 05/10/2020
***
This task involves writing a Python function called `sqrt2` that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. 

## Task 2 - 02/11/2020
***
The second task uses scipy.stats to verify a known Chi-squared value of 24.6 based on data table taken from the Wikipdeia article on the Chi-squared test (referenced in the jupyter notebook). It also calculates the p-value.

## Task 3 - 16/11/2020
***
For the third task, I research the Microsoft Excel functions `STDEV.S` and `STDEV.P`, writing a note about the difference between them. Then I use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the `STDEV.S` calculation is a better estimate than `STDEV.P` for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample.
