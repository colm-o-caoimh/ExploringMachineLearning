    "### Task 1 \n",
    "#### Write a Python function called `sqrt2` that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places\n",
    "\n",
    "* This program uses Newton's method (also known as the Newton-Raphson method) to calculate the square root of 2. It is commonly expressed as: \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = z - \\frac{z^2 - x}{2z}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The task requires that the function prints the result to 100 decimal places without using any modules from the standard library. \n",
    "* Python, however, stores floating point numbers correctly only to around 16 or 17 digits [1]. This is due to space limitations when storing these numbers in binary on the machine. \n",
    "* The square root of 2 is an *irrational number* and so it has an infinite number of decimals. Currently, the is has been computed to at least 10 trillion digits [2]. This exemplifies why floating point numbers in Python cannot have arbitrary precision. \n",
    "* In order to print such an irrational number to 100 decimal places, a different approach is needed. \n",
    "* The correct output could be displayed as a string, which would bypass the need to use a floating point number. Additionally it may be noted that integers in Python have arbitrary precision [3]. A combination of these two approaches may indeed be the route to completing this task to satisfaction.\n",
